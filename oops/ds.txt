abstraction and interfaces
1. both need classes
2. we can't create object both of them
3. we can create reference var for both them

differences
Abstract class


1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.

2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.

Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.

4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.

 The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.

7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".

8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.

Interface


Interface can have only abstract methods

Interface supports multiple inheritance.

Interface has only static and final variables.

Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.

The interface keyword is used to declare interface.

An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".

All the fields in interfaces are public, static and final by default
